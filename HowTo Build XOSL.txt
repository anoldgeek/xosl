How to build XOSL-OW
====================

In case Open Watcom version 1.8 has been installed on the PC using
the Open Watcom Windows Installer (open-watcom-c-win32-1.8.exe) there
is no need to modify the WatcomEnv.bat batch file before building 
xosl-ow.

In case open-watcom-c-win32-1.8.exe was opened as archive and files
have been extracted instead of being installed the WatcomEnv.bat batch 
file needs to be modified before building xosl-ow.

change 
  rem set WATCOM=[Drive]:\[Path]\WATCOM
into
  set WATCOM=[Drive]:\[Path]\WATCOM

with 
  [Drive] is the drive on which the extracted Open Watcom files are
	        located
	[Path]  is the path to the Open Watcom files, assuming 
	        files have been extracted to a folder named WATCOM


To build xosl-ow open a command prompt, navigate to the folder
containing the xosl-ow116 source files and execute the domake.bat 
batch file. 
After a successful build the Arch folder contains a total of 27 files. 
The file named install.exe is the XOSL installer. The other files are 
xosl specific files which are needed during XOSL installation. 

To remove all intermediate results from a previous build session use
the cleanmake.bat batch file.
