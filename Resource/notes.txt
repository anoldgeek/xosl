PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING NOTES CAREFULLY, BEFORE INSTALLING XOSL

Extended Operating System Loader comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, it
is destributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
The full license can be found in the GPL.TXT file.

1. This version additionally supports:
   a) > 2TB hard disks provided LBA is available.
   b) GPT paritioned disks.
   c) Upgrading  from older versions > 1.1.4
   d) When istalling on a dedicated partition, the option the choose 
      which HD, or none, the sector 0 the boot code is written to.
   
   

2. 'Easy upgrade' is now support for installs latter than XOSL 1.1.4. 
older versions will have to be completely reinstalled from scratch.

3. If you have any version older than 1.1.4 installed, it is recommened
to uninstall it before installing the latest XOSL. To perform a 
quick uninstall via DOS, execute 'fdisk /mbr'.

4. It is strongly recommended to install XOSL from a usb stick or CD. 
Using a usb stick you will save a backup of the data overwritten.

5. With XOSL comes Ranish Partition Manager, written by Mikhail
Ranish. Note that certain circumstances exist where it is not
free to use. Refer to http://www.ranish.com/part for the details.

6. With XOSL comes Smart Boot Manager (SBM). It is destributed 
under the terms of the GNU GPL. XOSL use SBM to indirectly 
support booting from CD-ROM. The CD-ROM booting howto can be
found in the manual/cdrom folder. The manual to SBM can be 
found in the manual/sbm folder. SBM can be found at 
http://btmgr.sourceforge.net. When an update of SBM is available,
and you want to install it, you will have to replace SBMINST.EXE,
as found in this distribution, with the new one, and completely 
reinstall XOSL.

-- NOTES ON INSTALLATION ON DOS DRIVE --
1. If installing from a usb device that mounts as C:, you must 
   install to a dedicated partition instead. See below.

-- NOTES ON INSTALLATION ON DEDICATED PARTITION --

1. You have to create a partition for XOSL yourself, BEFORE you
run install. The XOSL install utility does not create a partition
for you.

2. Select the partition you want to install XOSL onto carefully.
ALL DATA ON THE SELECTED PARTITION WILL BE DESTROYED! Although 
install provides an uninstall option, which can completely restore
the partition data, you should NEVER rely on such features.

3. If you install from floppy or usb (recommended), make sure that the
device has at least 879kb (900102 byte) of free disk space BEFORE you run
install (and after you have copied the XOSL install files to the 
device). If you don't install Ranish Partition Manager, only 816kb 
(834566 byte) of free disk space is required.
1.44Mb floppies are not large enough. Tested OK with 2.8Mb.

4. If installing from a usb device that mounts as C:, choose HD1 as
the device for installation of the sector 0 boot code.
